    company: Bright Health Solutions, Vancouver, BC Canada
    details: |
      - Independently designed and implemented a seamless integration between MOIS EMR and OceanMD, Canada’s leading provider of EMR-integrated eReferral solutions. Assigned as an almost entirely solo project, the integration required navigating complex challenges with minimal documentation and technical guidance. The solution was researched, designed, and executed using modern technologies and standards, including HL7 FHIR R4, .NET 6 with Entity Framework Core, and PostgreSQL, with Keycloak (deployed in Docker) serving as the OIDC provider for secure authentication. Core development was conducted using PowerBuilder 2022 R3 and ASP.NET Web API, with deployment as a scalable service on Microsoft Azure. Beyond full-stack development, responsibilities encompassed project management, business analysis, testing, and DevOps, ensuring a high-performance and resilient solution. This implementation streamlined workflows, enhanced data interoperability, and improved the user experience across both platforms.
      - Designed and implemented Microsoft Azure AD Authentication integration for MOIS EMR by developing an agnostic OIDC client, allowing users to seamlessly authenticate into MOIS with their Azure AD credentials while linking their MOIS accounts. Additionally, build a lightweight JWT CLI tool using .NET 9 to enhance PowerBuilder 2022 R3 compatibility, overcoming its limited native capability to support asymmetric signature verification required for the OAuth2 flow.
      - Designed and implemented a database schema logging system using PostgreSQL, resulting in an 80% reduction in execution time compared to application-level logging, while also enhancing data capture through JSONB for better flexibility and performance.
